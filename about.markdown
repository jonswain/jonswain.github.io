My name is Jon Swain. I'm a data scientist and cheminformatician. I am currently a Data Scientist at Veriphi Ltd in Auckland, New Zealand. I completed my undergraduate degree at University College, London, with a year abroad at the University of Toronto. I then went on to complete my PhD with Professor Chris Hunter at the University of Cambridge before moving to New Zealand to complete a postdoc with Distinguished Professor Dame Margaret Brimble. After a brief return to the UK, working at Vernalis Research near Cambridge, I returned to New Zealand to my current job at Veriphi.

Outside of my work in data science and cheminformatics, I spend most of my time outside, climbing, hiking, or rowing.
