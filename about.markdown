My name is Jon Swain. I'm a data scientist and cheminformatician. I am currently a Senior Scientist at Vernalis Research near Cambridge, UK. I completed my undergraduate degree at University College, London, with a year abroad at the University of Toronto. I then went on to complete my PhD with Professor Chris Hunter at the University of Cambridge. I moved to New Zealand to complete a postdoc with Distinguished Professor Dame Margaret Brimble, before returning to the UK and starting my current role at Vernalis.

Outside of my work in data science and cheminformatics, I spend most of my time outside, climbing, hiking, or rowing.
